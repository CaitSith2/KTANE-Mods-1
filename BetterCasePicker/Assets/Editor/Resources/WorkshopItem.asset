  Title: Better Case Picker
  Description: "[h1]About[/h1]\r\nThis mod changes how cases are picked by the game,
    making it so that the game will always pick from the smallest cases that fit all
    the modules on the bomb.\r\nIt also fixes an issue from the vanilla game where
    a case would be picked that doesn't fit all the modules.\r\nIt will also try to
    pick a case that fits all the modules on the front face of the bomb, if a mission
    requests that."
