  Title: SoundpackMaker
  Description: "[h1]About[/h1]\r\nThis mod allows you to easily create Soundpacks
    without having to create a custom mod.\r\n\r\n[b][u]NOTE:[/u][/b] Before continuing
    make sure you have booted up the game with the mod installed to create the necessary
    files and folders that you will need.\r\n\r\n[h1]Accepted Sound File Types[/h1]\r\nThe
    following sound file types should be used:\r\n[list]\r\n[*] .mp3\r\n[*] .wav\r\n[*]
    .ogg\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Soundpacks and How to Make One[/h1]\r\nEach soundpack
    is the name of a directory in the \"Soundpacks\" folder. This folder can be located
    in the same directory as the \u201CModsettings\u201D folder.\r\n\r\nTo make a
    soundpack:\r\nCreate a folder with the name of your new soundpack. Put this folder
    in the \"Soundpacks\" folder. This folder can contain any combination of the following:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]
    Folders - These must be named with one of the sound names listed below. Each folder
    can contain multiple sounds. The game will play one of these sound files instead
    of the default sound.\r\n[*] Sound files - These must be named with one of the
    sound names listed below. The game will play this sound file instead of the default
    sound.\r\n[/list]\r\nWhen you are done, add the soundpack name to list in the
    \"EnabledSoundPacks.json\" configuration file.\r\n\r\n[h1]Enabling Soundpacks[/h1]\r\nIn
    your \u201CModsettings\u201D folder there is a file called \"EnabledSoundpacks.json\"
    where you can list the names of the soundpacks you want to be enabled. If multiple
    soundpacks replace the same sound all of the sounds will be added together.\r\n\r\n[b][u]NOTE:[/u][/b]
    If you modify a soundpack or change the list of enabled soundpacks, you must restart
    the game for those changes to take effect.\r\n\r\n[h1]Sound Names[/h1]\r\nThe
